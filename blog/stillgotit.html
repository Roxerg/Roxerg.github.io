    <p>So last semester <strong>one</strong> of the existential crises I was having was whether I still like programming. The teaching season of the semester ended a few weeks ago, and my dissertation submission happened at the start of this week, and I already have an answer for this conundrum. </p>
    <p>Yes I do. I like programming very much. </p>
    <p>For the past few months, I&#39;ve been mainly working on either coursework, or my dissertation project. Latter I have considered a failure quite early on and my opinion has not changed now that I completed it. It simply did not live to my expectations, and it was mainly due to me limiting its scope severely. A rare problem for me. Anyway, if you would like to see who you are dealing with, you can read <a href='https://roxerg.github.io/dissertation.pdf'>my dissertation</a>, I guess. Point is, I did it out of necessity, I did not enjoy myself while doing it.</p>
    <p>Same for coursework - despite some of it being quite interesting, I found myself going through a path of least resistance, bashing out inefficient code when I&#39;m not marked for efficiency, not bothering to shorten it, commenting out of necessity. I was doing it for the grade and it was all that mattered. In this occasion, at least I can blame the very specific requirements for the assignments that would not really work for anything outside the vacuum of that small specific task being done, so why bother? </p>
    <p>But immediately, the same week I became (relatively) free (there&#39;s still an exam my dude), I have started on side projects. </p>
    <p>First, I began by rewriting a website that was just a bunch of static pages with <a href='https://vuejs.org/'>Vue</a>. I realized that I am not adding any functionality and it would suck to just tack on unnecessary JavaScript dependence on a site that worked fine without. So I found <a href='https://gridsome.org/'>Gridsome</a>, and rewrote the site in that. I learned a bunch of stuff in the process, including <a href='https://graphql.org/'>GraphQL</a>, which is both great and I hate it. The website was for a certain podcast that I&#39;m not linking directly :P. Oh, I also started hosting audio files with <a href='https://cloud.google.com/storage/'>Google Cloud</a> (not to get confused with Google&#39;s other cloud storage service - Google Drive), which is paid, but effectively free for the amount of space I&#39;m using. </p>
    <p>The second thing was a long-time coming, because I&#39;ve been thinking about it for a while - an album collage Discord bot from <a href='https://www.last.fm/'>Last.fm</a> listening history. It was super easy, because I used Python, and everything is super easy in Python. This was a rare case where both APIs were actually incredibly easy to use and comprehend. On the other hand, a bit more elbow grease will be required if I want to make the bot work with Discord&#39;s slash (/) commands. It was incredibly fun to bash out and see people mess about with it hours later.</p>
    <p>So, what&#39;s the conclusion? I suppose I&#39;m just really bad at formal learning, or I don&#39;t have an attention span for it. Alternatively, it&#39;s the mental play/work dichotomy, and just by placing an activity in either context, makes me feel vastly differently about it. It&#39;s probably a mix of both. </p>
    <p>Funnily enough, I have been looking forward to reading all this time, and I procrastinated that with all this development fun. Could it be that I am now mentally putting reading books into the &quot;chore&quot; camp, and thus trying to avoid it? Or maybe it&#39;s just my disintegrating attention span... But that&#39;s a story for another time.  </p>
